The problem : 

Suppose you're a shop owner, and you allow credit system to the most loyal of your customers (lets call them VIPs).
There are few customers with whom, you've established a credit system. 
Now, you need a program that tallies the products bought by the VIPs and adds them to their tabs. 
Insert the data in a file and save it for future uses. When the customer comes to pay, 
add data in the file and keep track of the amount paid by another customer in another file.
